## General info

A website containing solutions for the famous python challenge.

Each solution contains a description of the problem, and the approach on how to solve it, and a code block, containing the code used to solve each puzzle.

Solutions are written in Typescript, in a form of just regular functions, backend code (Node) or React components, depending on what was required for the puzzle.

Packages used are also listed in each solution.

## But why?

Practice and exploring the capabilities of the language while solving some puzzles.

## Setup

To run this project locally, clone it and install using npm:
